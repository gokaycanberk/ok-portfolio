          Hi! I'm Ozge, a dedicated interior and digital designer who graduated
          from Beykent University in 2017 with a degree in Interior Architecture
          and Environmental Design. Since then, I have built a diverse
          portfolio, working on a variety of projects that blend functionality
          with creative aesthetics. With a passion for both art and design, I've
          gained experience in multiple fields, including digital design and 3D
          visualization.
